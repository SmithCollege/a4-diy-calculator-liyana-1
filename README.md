# A4 DIY Calculator

Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Member Name(s): n/a

Other collaborators you worked with, including TAs (and feel free to give a shoutout to anyone who was particularly helpful): n/a

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials: chatgpt to remind me of syntax for if statements and to understand errors i was getting during debugging, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html, https://stackoverflow.com/questions, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shunting-yard_algorithm&oldid=572362024

Reflection on your experience with this assignment: this one was tough with the logic, and i will admit that im not totally sure how to convert expressions to postfix and that made this assignment tough. i definetly felt like it was rewarding though, which is nice. i will also note that i found the lumping of tests a bit tough to use as i had to manually copy and pase every one into my main file to run them and figure out which inputs were the ones taht weren't working as anticipated. but overall, lots of fun!

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?
